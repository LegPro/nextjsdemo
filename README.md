# nextjsdemo

A simple project using React.js, Next.js, and MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.12.0 or compatible)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LegPro/nextjsdemo.git
cd nextjsdemo
```

### 2. Set up a MongoDB Database

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running. You can install it from the official [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) if you haven't already. After installation, start the MongoDB server.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the `env.local.example` file in the project directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Open the `.env.local` file and set the following environment variables:

- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string. This should look like `mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/your-database-name`.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install project dependencies using npm or yarn.

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 5. Run Next.js in Development Mode

Now, you can start the development server. Run one of the following commands, depending on your package manager of choice.

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Your application should now be up and running locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
